# Go Timer

## description

Basic Timing: The timer allows players to set the initial time for their match, as well as adjust the amount of time each player has for their turns. It will alert players when their time is running low, and notify them when their time has run out.

Byo-Yomi Support: For games that use byo-yomi, the timer will support this mode and alert players when they have entered byo-yomi, as well as keep track of the number of periods and time remaining in each period.
